[Existing work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04385) showed evidence of a link between financial crashes and topological features computed from persistent landscapes over sliding windows of american indices.

Inspired from their word, I studied the correlation between the magnitude of the log returns of european indices with the norm of the topological features of degree 0 and 1 
of persistent homology computed with the Rips filtration, via [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) over sliding windows of 50 days.

In particular, I show that high values of this topological measure, mentionned as Topological Crash Metric (TMC), can significantly precede large variations in the FTSE index by a hundred days.
